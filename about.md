To understand the mysterious, to simplify the complex, to glean intuition from mindless chaos - that is my goal. The pleasure derived from connecting the dots between seemingly unrelated concepts, and distilling an insightful understanding of the world around me, and the world in our thoughts, is what motivates me.  The abundance of such conceptual links riddled throughout fields like mathematics and physics make them very interesting to me. I hope to share some of my stumbling adventures through a tiny part of the vast world of scientific knowledge in this blog.
