To understand the mysterious, to simplify the complex, to glean intuition from mindless order - that is my goal. The pleasure derived from connecting the dots between seemingly unrelated concepts, and distilling an insightful understanding of the world around me, and the world in our thoughts, is what motivates me.  Mathematics and Physics are riddled with numerous such ensembles of thought and conceptual links, and are my primary interests. I hope to share some of my adventures and experiences in the world of science and math through this blog.
