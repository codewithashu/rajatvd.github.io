My name is Rajat Vadiraj Dwaraknath and I’m currently an Electrical Engineering undergrad at IIT Madras. I’ve always been fascinated when seemingly unrelated concepts from different fields and subjects link together to form an insightful explanation of the world around us. The abundance of such conceptual links in fields like mathematics and physics make them particularly interesting to me. I hope to share some of my stumbling attempts at understanding them in this blog.
